[START INSTRUCTIONS]

Given the project structure, summarize the main functionalities of the project, listing each model with a high-level description of its role and key interactions.
1. Provide a basic pseudocode outline for each modelâ€™s calculate method (Upload and Report Model basically), mentioning:
    - Primary steps for data processing, report generation, and any conditional logic.
    - Any logging actions.
    - Simplified placeholders for complex calculations, with notes on intended outcomes.
    - Avoid specific implementation details; instead, focus on the sequence and purpose of steps in each model.
2. Present this information in markdown format without code snippets.
