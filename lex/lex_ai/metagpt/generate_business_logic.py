[START INSTRUCTIONS]

1. Given the project structure, enhance the basic pseudocode provided in the functionalities step by adding detailed business logic for each modelâ€™s calculate method. Incorporate specifics on data processing, complex calculations, and any conditional steps.
2. Include validation checks for each calculate method:
    - Confirm that each step in the pseudocode aligns with the intended functionality and business logic.
    - Cross-check that calculations, logging with LexLogger, and any necessary data transformations are included and correctly ordered.
    - Highlight any potential gaps or issues within the calculation logic.
3. Log any key operations as required by project guidelines using LexLogger.
4. Avoid including fields from CalculationModel or LexModel unless they are specific to this project.
5. Present the business logic in markdown format with only descriptive text (no code snippets).
6. Please add a user story or scenario that demonstrates the use of the business logic in a real-world context.

### Guidelines:

- **Structure Your Response Using Markdown:**
  - Use level 2 headers (`##`) for main sections.
  - Use bolding (`**`) for subsections.
  
- **Content Requirements:**
  1. **Project Overview:**
     - Provide a brief summary of the project based on the provided context and structure.
  
  2. **Business Logic Description:**
     - For each class that extends `CalculationModel` or `LexModel`:
       - **Class Name:**
         - **Inheritance:** Specify the parent class (`CalculationModel` or `LexModel`).
         - **Logging:** Mention the use of `LexLogger` for logging activities.

       - **Calculate Method:**
         - **Purpose:** Explain what the `calculate()` method is intended to achieve within the class.
         - **Chain-of-Thought Explanation:** Detail the step-by-step reasoning process that the method follows to perform its calculations.
         - **Pseudo-Code:** Provide a thorough and documented pseudo-code representation of the `calculate()` method, highlighting key operations and logic flows.
         
  3. **Inheritance and Overriding:**
     - Clearly specify any inheritance hierarchies and overridden methods, especially focusing on the `calculate()` methods where applicable.

- **Formatting Requirements:**
  - Use **unordered lists** for items.
  - Present comparisons in **markdown tables** for clarity.
  - Ensure all explanations are self-contained and do not require external references.
  
- **Style:**
  - Maintain an unbiased and journalistic tone.
  - Use italics for highlighting specific terms or phrases.
  - Avoid including URLs, links, or bibliographies.
  - Ensure the response is concise yet comprehensive, avoiding unnecessary repetition.

**[START INSTRUCTIONS]**
1. Based on the provided project structure, detail the business logic of the project in markdown format.
2. Utilize the `lex_app` framework as the foundation for the project structure.
3. Extend or utilize the existing models and methods of the `lex_app`; do not create new models.
4. Ensure all models extend either `CalculationModel` or `LexModel` based on their functionality.
5. Implement logging using `LexLogger`.
6. Specify inheritance relationships where they exist.
7. Override the `calculate` method of `CalculationModel` for classes that require processing, uploading of data, or both.
8. Exclude fields inherited from `CalculationModel` or `LexModel`, focusing only on project-specific fields.
9. For models extending `CalculationModel`, provide a detailed and documented pseudo-code implementation of the overridden `calculate()` method, illustrating how data processing or uploading is handled.

**[STOP INSTRUCTIONS]**

**Output**:
Return the comprehensive business logic in markdown format, incorporating detailed explanations and documented pseudo-code for every `calculate()` method within each relevant class. Ensure the response follows the formatting and style guidelines outlined above.
