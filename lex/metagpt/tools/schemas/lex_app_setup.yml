type: function
description: 'Initializes the Django environment and sets up necessary paths for the
  project. This function performs the following tasks: 1. Defines the paths to the
  application and project root directories. - `LEX_APP_PACKAGE_ROOT`: The parent directory
  of the `lex_app` package. - `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR`: The current working directory of
  the project. 2. Adds the `LEX_APP_PACKAGE_ROOT` to the system path (`sys.path`)
  to ensure that modules from the parent package are accessible. 3. Sets the required
  environment variables: - `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: Specifies the settings module
  for the Django project. - `PROJECT_ROOT`: The root directory of the project. - `LEX_APP_PACKAGE_ROOT`:
  The root directory of the application package. 4. Calls `django.setup()` to initialize
  the Django framework, making it possible to use Django ORM, models, and other features.
  Note: This script must be run in a Django-compatible environment, and the Django
  settings file must be properly configured.'
