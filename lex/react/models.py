# Create your models here.
"""
This module is intended for defining Django models.

Models are the single, definitive source of information about your data. They contain the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.
