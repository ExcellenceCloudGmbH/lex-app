## Cluster 10 — API Layer (existing 10a–10f)

### Batch 10g — Calculation-log tree, clean, init, PDF

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 10.30 – 10.45 |
| Type | E |
| Files covered | `views/model_entries/CalculationLogTreeView.py`, `views/model_entries/serializers/CalculationLogTreeSerializer.py`, `views/calculations/CleanCalculations.py`, `views/calculations/InitCalculationLogs.py`, `views/calculations/DownloadMarkdownPdf.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/api_layer/test_calc_endpoints.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCalculationLogTreeEndpoint`, `TestCalculationLogTreeSerializerShape`, `TestCleanCalculationsEndpoint`, `TestInitCalculationLogsEndpoint`, `TestDownloadMarkdownPdfEndpoint` |
| Fixtures | `CalcWithLogging` from 6g, plus a fixture seeding a small log tree |
| Est. tests | ~15 |
| Coverage gain | +0.9 % |
| Prereqs | 6g, 6i |

### Batch 10h — File operations & SharePoint

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 10.46 – 10.60 |
| Type | E + I |
| Files covered | `views/file_operations/FileDownload.py`, `utilities/storage/custom_storage.py`, `views/sharepoint/SharePointPreview.py`, `SharePointShareLink.py`, `SharePointFileDownload.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/api_layer/test_files_and_sharepoint.py` |
| Test classes | `TestFileDownloadEndpoint`, `TestCustomStorageBackendSelection` (env-driven branch), `TestSharePointPreview`, `TestSharePointShareLink`, `TestSharePointFileDownload` (mock SP HTTP boundary) |
| Fixtures | `FileBackedItem` (model with a FileField); mock SharePoint client |
| Est. tests | ~14 |
| Coverage gain | +0.8 % |
| Prereqs | none |

### Batch 10m — Calculation-log tree pagination + N+1 fix ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 10.61 – 10.66 |
| Type | I |
| Files covered | `views/model_entries/CalculationLogTreeView.py`, `views/model_entries/serializers/CalculationLogTreeSerializer.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/api_layer/test_10m_calculation_log_tree.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster10m_TreeViewPagination` |
| Fixtures | none (creates `CalculationLog` rows inline) |
| Est. tests | 6 |
| Coverage gain | measured locally; tree view + serializer |
| Prereqs | none |
| Status | ✅ Complete — 6 pass / 0 fail |
| Note | Backend OOM fix (session 77). The tree endpoint previously loaded the whole `CalculationLog` table (or every row for a calc) with a per-node child query (N+1). Now: limit/offset pagination (`DEFAULT_LIMIT=1000`, `MAX_LIMIT=5000`, `has_more`), children resolved for the whole page in one query via serializer context, `get_isRoot` reads `parent_log_id` (no lazy parent fetch). Scenario 10.61 placed past the 10.60 ceiling; the 10g-reserved "calculation-log tree" slot was never implemented (the on-disk 10g file became `one_endpoint_lifecycle`), so this lands as 10m. |

> `ModelExport.py` (cluster 13f), `List.py` AG-Grid path (14f), `base_serializers.py` (12g) keep their forecasted homes.

### Batch 10o — MCP embed-view tool ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 10.72 – 10.80 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/mcp_server/tools/embed.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/api_layer/test_10o_embed_view_tool.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster10o_ClassifyPath`, `TestCluster10o_BuildEmbedUrl`, `TestCluster10o_ResolveFrontendUrl`, `TestCluster10o_CspOrigins`, `TestCluster10o_EmbedViewInner` |
| Fixtures | module-level stubs for `fastmcp`, `lex.mcp_server.config/registry/context`, `mcp.types` |
| Tests | 27 |
| Coverage gain | embed.py pure helpers + async tool handler |
| Prereqs | none |
| Status | ✅ Complete — 27 pass / 0 fail |
| Note | Coverage task for PR #703 (fix/mcp-server-fastmcp4-port). The sibling modules (config, registry, context) live on an unmerged branch, so the module is loaded by path and stubs replace the missing imports. |
